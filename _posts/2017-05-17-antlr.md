# Elements of ANTLR

## Comments
Commens are as same as C language.

## Identifiers
* Token names start with a capital letter. Tokens are processed by lexer.
* Rule names start with a lowercase letter. Rules are processed by parser.

## Literals
Literals are surrounded by single quotes (-> 'hello world')

## Actions
Actions are surrounded by curly braces (-> {...}).

## Keywords
* import
* fragment
* lexer
* parser
* grammer
* returns
* locals
* throws
* catch
